I am a **Master of Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. Before this, I completed my B.Sc. in Intelligence Science and Technology at the [Zhi Class](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/rcpy/zbpy/zbjj.htm), [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).

I have been fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io/) from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) and [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://yansongfeng.github.io/) from the [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in **large language model reasoning and machine learning systems**. I have worked on:
- Examining **collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion model sampling**.  
- Developing **reinforcement learning frameworks to enhance LLM legal reasoning** on Chinese bar exam multi-choice QA, achieving improved structured reasoning and accuracy.  

I am seeking opportunities in **machine learning systems and applied AI**, where I can contribute to building reliable, scalable, and impactful AI technologies.
