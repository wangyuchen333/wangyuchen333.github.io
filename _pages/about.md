I am a final-year undergraduate student from the [Zhi Class](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/rcpy/zbpy/zbjj.htm) at the [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io/) from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) and [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://yansongfeng.github.io/) from the [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). 

I'm seeking collaboration opportunities to unravel the mysteries behind the power of LLMs.

I'm currently in the midst of seeking a Research Assistant (RA) position. My ambition is to contribute to innovative projects and sharpen my research acumen.
